      Just as the lungs produce thick, sticky mucus, the pancreas also makes thick mucus that blocks the release of enzymes needed for digestion. Most people with cystic fibrosis need to take enzymes before they eat.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Taken by mouth, the enzymes go to work in the intestines so you can digest food and absorb the nutrients to keep your body healthy. It is important that you take the right amount of enzymes, so check with your doctor, nurse or dietitian on your CF care
      team for the exact amount of enzymes to take.
    </p>

      Most pancreatic enzyme supplements come in capsule form. Inside each capsule are many small beads that contain the digestive enzymes. Each bead is covered with a special enteric coating. This coating allows the beads to dissolve in the small intestine.
      The digestive enzymes are then released in the small intestine to help digest food. Enzymes work for about 45 to 60 minutes after taking them.

      Enzymes work by helping you to:
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      1-Digest carbohydrates, proteins and fats (the three nutrients in food that supply calories)
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      2-Gain and maintain a healthy weight
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      3-Absorb essential nutrients such as vitamins and minerals
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      In the short term, not taking your enzymes or not taking the proper dose can lead to poorly digested fat, protein or starch. The poorly digested food sits in your intestines, which causes gas, pain and unpleasant smells. It can also cause problems ranging
      from constipation and DIOS to loose, floating, greasy, frequent stools.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      In the long term, better lung function is associated with higher body weight, so it is very important to take enzymes with all meals and snacks. If you have trouble paying for enzymes or have questions about coverage of them, please contact CF Foundation
      Compass, which can connect you to resources that can assist you.

      A 2016 study showed that if a parent caregiver has depression, their children with CF are less likely to take their enzymes. If you have a child with CF and you are experiencing symptoms of depression, please talk to your health care provider about treatment.
