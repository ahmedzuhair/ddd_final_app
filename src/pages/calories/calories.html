      People with cystic fibrosis need extra calories for several reasons. Although they take pancreatic enzymes, they still aren&#39;t able to use 100 percent of the energy they consume because enzymes cannot break down everything they eat or correct their
      problems with absorbing nutrients.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Fighting infections and coughing on a regular basis also burns extra calories. Maintaining a healthy weight -- and sometimes increasing it -- is key to fighting infection and keeping your lungs and body strong. By making small changes in your daily routine,
      you can make a big difference in your weight. Tips for Planning and Preparing Meals
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Give yourself time to plan. Before you go to sleep, think about the busy day ahead. Where will you be spending your time? Where can you easily stash food? Is there a refrigerator nearby? Microwave? How about a place to eat? Will you have enough enzymes?
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Think about “packability.” Plan meals or snacks that you can carry in your backpack, purse, or briefcase and store in your desk drawer, locker, or a cooler in your car. Buy a variety of foods so you don&#39;t get tired of eating the same foods every day.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Cook once to eat three times. When cooking, make enough to pack a meal for tomorrow&#39;s lunch or use plastic containers to freeze meals that you can easily “grab &#39;n&#39; go.”
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Use a slow cooker. For breakfast, overnight oatmeal made with heavy cream and dried fruit and nuts is a hearty start to the day. If you find that you have more energy earlier in the day, make dinner in the slow cooker so that at 5 p.m. you don&#39;t settle
      for pizza or fast food.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      If you are cooking for only one or two people, look for magazines and recipe books designed for smaller portions so food doesn&#39;t go to waste. Or, make a full portion and freeze part of it for when you&#39;re not feeling up to cooking.

      The webcast below highlights the following information:
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Women with CF should consume 2,500 calories a day to maintain their weight and 3,000 calories a day to gain weight.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Men with CF should consume 3,000 calories a day to maintain their weight and up to 3,700 calories a day to gain weight.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      People with CF will not be able to benefit from fat-soluble vitamins if they don&#39;t eat enough fat or take enough enzymes to digest those fats.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      People with CF may need to increase their enzyme dose if they have bulky, greasy stools.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Women with CF who want to become pregnant should take a prenatal vitamin to ensure they get enough folic acid. Once they are pregnant, they will need at least an extra 300 calories a day if not more.
